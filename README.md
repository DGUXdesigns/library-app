# üìö Library App

This Library App is a simple, interactive web application built using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. The app allows users to create and manage a list of books, marking them as "read" or "unread" with dynamic updates to the user interface.

The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate my proficiency with **JavaScript** and **constructor functions**, showcasing how I can manipulate the DOM, handle user input, and apply interactive features.

## Features üöÄ
- **Add Books**: Users can add a new book by entering details like title, author, chapter count, and read status in a modal form.
- **Toggle Read Status**: Users can mark books as "read" or "unread" using a checkbox, with the corresponding book card‚Äôs visual state updating accordingly (a glowing border appears when marked as "read").
- **Remove Books**: Users can remove books from the library with a single click.
- **Responsive Design**: The app is responsive, adapting its layout for different screen sizes.

## Purpose üéØ
The goal of this project is to highlight my **JavaScript** skills, specifically focusing on the use of **constructor functions** to create reusable objects. Additionally, this app showcases how I can:
- Dynamically update the DOM in response to user interactions.
- Implement basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations.
- Use event listeners and callback functions for interactive features.
- Apply CSS transitions and effects for a smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used ‚öôÔ∏è
- **HTML**: Structuring the app and creating the modal form.
- **CSS**: Styling the interface with modern design techniques, including responsive layout and animations.
- **JavaScript**: Managing the app's core functionality with constructor functions, DOM manipulation, event handling, and dynamic updates to the UI.

## How to Use üõ†Ô∏è
1. Open the app in a browser.
2. Click the "Add Book" button to open the modal and input book details.
3. After adding a book, you can mark it as read by checking the "I've read this already" checkbox. The book card will show a glowing border when marked as "read."
4. Remove books by clicking the "Remove" button on their respective card.

## Installation ‚ö°
To install and run the app locally:
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
